    <h3>IMPLICATIONS</h3>
    <h4>AESTHETICS</h4> 
    <p>aesthetics is the part of design were you begin to think about what the plan for your charecter is going to look like<br>when designing your aesthitics i beleive you have to have the rest of your game in mind to not just the charecter because if the map is very low quality but the charecter is super high quality he will look out of place </p>
    <p>im going for a over all very simple design its most liekely going to be a group of low poly shapes without much color to make it very simple and with basic clor scemes</p>
